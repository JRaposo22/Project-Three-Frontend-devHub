## Description

This is an app to help new developers to search and prepare for a new job in the tech world. The app offers a list of random interviews questions, a list of hints (that can be also generated by users) and a list of jobs (that can be also generated by users).

## User Stories

-  **404:** As a user I get to see a 404 page with a feedback message if I try to reach a page that does not exist so that I know it's my fault.
-  **Signup:** As an anonymous user I can sign up on the platform so that I can start looking for jobs, hints and do the quiz.
-  **Login:** As a user I can login to the platform so that I can access my profile and start looking for jobs, hints and do the quiz.
-  **Logout:** As a logged in user I can logout from the platform so no one else can use it.
